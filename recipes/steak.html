  <h3>Steak is a food that can be described as tender, flavorful, juicy, and cooked to perfection; in fact, most consumers describe their ideal steak as just that:<p>"A tender, flavorful, medium-rare steak that isn't overly salty." "Tender, juicy, cooked perfectly and perfectly seasoned."</p> </h3>

  <h2> How to prepare the steak</h2>
  <p>
    <h3>Season the steak with salt up to 2 hrs before, then with pepper just before cooking.
Heat a heavy-based frying pan until very hot but not smoking.
Drizzle some oil into the pan and leave for a moment.
Add the steak, a knob of butter, some garlic and robust herbs, if you want.
Sear evenly on each side for our recommended time, turning every minute for the best caramelised crust.
Leave to rest on a board or warm plate for about 5 mins.
Serve the steak whole or carved into slices with the resting juices poured over.</h3>
